        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>These Terms of Service (TOS) apply to all TikTok accounts created and managed by me, the owner of the application, including,</br> but not limited to, accounts that publish content such as random meme generators, fake deep quotes, and other similar content,</br>
            both in French and English.
            By using any of these accounts, I acknowledge that I have read and accepted these TOS.
        </p>

        <p>The developed application automates the posting of videos on TikTok.</br> These videos include random memes, fake deep quotes,</br> montages with calm music, and other similar content.

        <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>I commit to using the application and accounts responsibly,</br> in compliance with applicable laws and the rules imposed by TikTok.</br> I acknowledge that any attempt to abuse the automation, violate TikTok's rules,</br> or bypass the platform's systems may result in the suspension or deletion of my accounts.

        </p>
        <h2>6. Revenue and Monetization</h2>
        <p>
            The application allows videos to be automatically posted on TikTok,</br> and it is possible that revenue may be generated through monetization programs</br> (e.g., TikTok Creator Program, brand partnerships).
    I acknowledge that: </br></br>
    â€¢ All revenue generated through the use of the application</br> and the accounts is subject to TikTok's terms and conditions and local tax laws.</br></br>
    â€¢ I am solely responsible for managing,</br> declaring, and paying taxes on the revenue generated through TikTok or any associated platform. </br>
        </p>
        <h2>7. Account Security</h2>
        <p>I am entirely responsible for the security of my TikTok accounts and the associated information.</br> I take the necessary measures to protect my credentials</br> and acknowledge that any unauthorized use or security breach is my responsibility.</p>
        <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>I acknowledge that the application may encounter errors or interruptions.</br> I am responsible for the consequences related to improper use of the application or technical failures.</br>
            The application and associated services are provided "as is," without any warranty.</br> I cannot hold the application responsible for losses or damages caused by its use.</br>
        </p>
        <h2>9. Modification of Terms</h2>
        <p>I reserve the right to modify these TOS at any time.</br> Changes will be updated and documented to apply to all accounts and services.</p>
        <h2>10. Termination</h2>
        <p>
            I may decide to suspend or stop using the application at any time.</br> Additionally, if TikTok imposes sanctions on my accounts due to a violation of these TOS,</br> I acknowledge that this may result in the termination of access to automation services and the TikTok platform.
        </p>
        <h2>11. Language</h2>
        <p>These TOS apply equally to my accounts in both French and English.</br> A translated version may be made available if necessary, but the spirit and obligations of these TOS remain identical.</p>
        <h2>12. Contact</h2>
